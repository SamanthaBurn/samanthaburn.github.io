Should governments outsource publicly funded healthcare to the private sector? I study the aggregate and distributional effects of partial outsourcing in the context of a major policy reform in the English National Health Service that allowed patients to choose treatment at private hospitals as well as incumbent public hospitals. Private hospitals locate in high-income areas and treat less severe patients. Using variation in market-level exposure to the reform, I find that outsourcing increased volume of elective admissions and reduced wait times. Exposure to outsourcing slightly increased average severity of the patients at nearby public hospitals but did not reduce physician labor supply. I use variation from the reform to estimate a model of patient demand in the presence of capacity constraints. Outsourcing increased patient surplus and reduced average wait time by 16%. One third of gains come from reduced congestion at public hospitals. Gains for patients in the top quintile of the income distribution are 55% higher than for patients in the bottom quintile. Results highlight the potential for outsourcing to expand patient choice and relieve public sector congestion, at the cost of increasing inequality in access to care.

High administrative costs in US health care have provoked concern among policymakers over potential waste, but many of these costs are generated by managed care policies that trade off bureaucratic costs against reductions in moral hazard. We study this trade-off for prior authorization restriction policies in Medicare Part D, where low-income beneficiaries are randomly assigned to default plans. Beneficiaries who face restrictions on a drug reduce their use of it by 26.8%. Approximately half of marginal beneficiaries are diverted to another related drug, while the other half are diverted to no drug. These policies generated net financial savings, reducing drug spending by $96 per beneficiary-year (3.6% of drug spending), while only generating approximately $10 in paperwork costs. Revealed preference approaches suggest that the cost savings likely exceed beneficiaries’ willingness to pay for foregone drugs.

<span style ="font-size:.9em;">**Suburban Housing and Urban Affordability: Evidence from Residential Vacancy Chains** (with Valentine Gilbert) 2023. *Valentine's Job Market Paper*</span> <br/> <small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('VCs')">Abstract</a> | [PDF][VCs]]</small>

<div id="VCs" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
This paper investigates the role that residential vacancy chains – the sequence of moves across housing units initiated by the construction of a new housing unit – play in linking different housing submarkets. We focus in particular on how the market for  suburban single-family homes affects the market for dense urban housing in multifamily buildings. Using administrative data on the residential histories of the U.S. population, we describe the distribution of vacancies created by different kinds of new housing. A key finding is that vacancy chains end quickly, with 90% ending within three rounds of moves. We then conduct a simulation exercise to understand what the observed patterns of vacancy chains imply about the welfare and price effects of new housing supply. We show that the geographic distribution of moves created by vacancy chains is correlated with the geographic distribution of welfare and price effects, and that the number of vacancies created in a neighborhood is as strong a predictor of price effects as are model-derived  crossneighborhood substitution effects. These results, along with our descriptive results, imply that the incidence of the benefits of new housing depend strongly on what kind of housing is built and where.

This paper presents a review of mostly experimental evidence demonstrating the potential usefulness of simplifying the college admission and enrollment process. Seemingly small differences in the process of students transitioning to college often determine whether some matriculate or not. Behavioral models that imply the possibility of sub-optimal long-run outcomes may be needed to better explain these results. We argue that the model which fits the results best is one where some students are inattentive to their college possibilities and therefore let opportunity slip by. Making the process to get to college easier and more salient helps offset this inattentiveness and prevents some exiting high school from falling through the cracks.

Behavioural economics incorporates ideas from psychology, sociology and neuroscience to better predict how individuals make long-term decisions. Often the ideas adopted include present or inattention bias, both potentially leading to suboptimal outcomes. But these models also point to opportunities for effective, low-cost government policies that can have meaningful positive effects on people's long-term well-being. The last decade has been marked by a growing interest from governments the world over in using behavioural economics to inform policy decisions. This is true of Canada as well. In this paper we discuss the increasingly important role behavioural economics plays in Canadian public policy. We first contextualize government policies that have incorporated insights from behavioural economics by outlining a collection of models of intertemporal choice. We then present examples of public policy initiatives that are based upon findings in the field, placing particular emphasis on Canadian initiatives. We also document future opportunities, challenges and limitations.
