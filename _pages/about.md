<font size = "2"> I am a Ph.D. candidate in Public Policy (Economics Track) at the Harvard Kennedy School. **I am also on the 2023-24 job market.**  

I am an applied microeconomist with research interests in Public and Urban Economics. My research tries to understand the consequences of urban sorting for spatial inequality and the welfare of low-income households. 

My job market paper combines large-scale administrative census data and tools from empirical industrial organization to understand the consequences of gentrification for low-income incumbent residents. Other research combines similar data and empirical tools to understand the optimal design of urban economic policy to promote upward mobility among disadvantaged children. I am also a co-author on Valentine Gilbertâ€™s job market paper, which seeks to understand the downstream consequences of new urban housing supply. </font>
