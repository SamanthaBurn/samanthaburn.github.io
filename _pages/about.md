I am a PhD Candidate in Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School and the 2020 recipient of the [Joseph Crump Fellowship](https://heep.hks.harvard.edu/news/heep-pre-doctoral-fellow-awarded-joseph-crump-fellowship-2020).

Prior to starting my PhD, I worked as a research assistant at Resources for the Future. I graduated summa cum laude from Pomona College, with a BA in Economics. I enjoy hiking and pottery and am a nonresident tutor at Lowell House and a member of the Graduate Women in Economics core team.
