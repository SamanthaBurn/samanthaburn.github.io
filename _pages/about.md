I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Public Policy at Harvard University. I am a Harvard Environmental Economics Program Pre-Doctoral Fellow and the 2020 recipient of the [Joseph Crump Fellowship](https://heep.hks.harvard.edu/news/heep-pre-doctoral-fellow-awarded-joseph-crump-fellowship-2020). My research focuses on how air pollution and climate change exacerbate social inequality and the opportunities for environmental policies to mitigate these impacts.

Prior to starting my Ph.D., I worked as a research assistant at Resources for the Future. I graduated *summa cum laude* from Pomona College, with a B.A. in Economics. My research has been published in the *American Journal of Agricultural Economics*, *RAND Journal of Economics*, *Energy Policy*, *Environmental Law Reporter*, and the *Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society*. 

I am on the 2022-23 job market and will be available for interviews.
