<span style ="font-size:.9em;"> I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of [Health Care Policy](https://hcp.hms.harvard.edu) at Harvard Medical School. I recently received my PhD in [Health Policy](https://healthpolicy.fas.harvard.edu) (Economics track) from Harvard. </span>  

<span style ="font-size:.9em;"> I am an applied microeconomist specializing in health economics and public finance. My current research focuses on "ordeals" and rationing in healthcare, the interaction of the public and private sectors in financing and provision of healthcare and the role of public health insurance in redistribution. I have a particular interest in how public policy can improve equity of access to health care and health outcomes. </span>   

<span style ="font-size:.9em;"> Prior to my doctoral studies, I obtained a B.A. in Philosophy, Politics and Economics and an M.Phil. in Economics from Oxford University. I spent time as an [Overseas Development Institute fellow](https://odi.org/en/fellowship-scheme/) in the Republic of South Sudan, and worked at the World Bank, Bates White LLC and the University of Birmingham, UK. </span>  

<span style ="font-size:.9em;"> Harvard is located on the traditional and ancestral land of the [Massachusett](https://massachusetttribe.org), the original inhabitants of what is now known as Boston and Cambridge. I acknowledge and pay respect to the people of the Massachusett Tribe, past and present, and honor the land itself which remains sacred to the Massachusett People.
