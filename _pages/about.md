<span style ="font-size:.9em;"> I am a Ph.D. candidate in Public Policy (Economics Track) at the Harvard Kennedy School and **on the 2023-24 job market.**  </span>  


As an applied microeconomist, my research centers on Public and Urban Economics. My research tries to understand the consequences of urban sorting for spatial inequality and the welfare of low-income households. My job market paper combines large-scale administrative census data and tools from empirical industrial organization to understand the consequences of gentrification for low-income incumbent residents.  

Prior to my doctoral studies, I obtained a B.A. and M.A. in economics from the University of Toronto.  

My research is supported by the [Horowitz Foundation for Social Policy](https://www.horowitz-foundation.org/) as well as the [Malcolm Wiener Center for Social Policy](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/wiener).
