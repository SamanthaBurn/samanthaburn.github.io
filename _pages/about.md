<span style ="font-size:.9em;"> I am an Assistant Professor of [Economics and Public Policy](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/faculty-research/academic-areas/economics-public-policy/) at Imperial College Business School in London. I am also an affiliate of the [Centre for Health Economics & Policy Innovation](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/faculty-research/research-centres/centre-health-economics-policy-innovation/). </span>  

<span style ="font-size:.9em;"> I am an applied microeconomist specializing in health economics and public finance. My current research focuses on "ordeals" and rationing in healthcare, the interaction of the public and private sectors in financing and provision of healthcare and the role of public health insurance in redistribution. I have a particular interest in how public policy can improve equity of access to health care and health outcomes. </span>   

<span style ="font-size:.9em;"> I received my PhD in [Health Policy](https://healthpolicy.fas.harvard.edu) (Economics track) from Harvard and was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Department of Healthcare Policy](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/faculty-research/academic-areas/economics-public-policy/](https://hcp.hms.harvard.edu) at Harvard Medical School.
